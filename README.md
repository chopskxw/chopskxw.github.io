This website is built with Pelican using the `Lannisport` theme available [here](http://github.com/siovene/lannisport).  Deployments are automated using [Travis CI](travis-ci.org).  And, a special thanks to [jduncan-rva](https://github.com/jduncan-rva) for the helping me out.  Check out his writeup on building this out [here](http://blog.jeduncan.com/pelican_blog_setup.html#pelican_blog_setup).
