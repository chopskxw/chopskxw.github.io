### A tech entusiast living in a technology desert.

That is probably the simpliest summary of me.  This is probably why I am the only Red Hatter in southern WV.  Be that as it may, I truly love what I do and I'm ecstatic that I can do it where I live.  

Both for work and play, I frequently play with new FOSS.  I run a 3 node RHV cluster in a 38U rack beside my desk, just so I have a place to play.  Aside from that I have a home network that is way over kill--soon to include fiber links.  the best part is all of this is connected to the world via a 3mbps DSL pipe.  Yes, that is 3 Megabits per second.  You would be surprised what is possible with so little bandwidth, but some things are certainly just plain painful.

When I'm not home, I can usually be found at the local fire station.  I have dedicated 13 years of my life to the fire service and serving my community.  I have been a memeber of the Danville Volunteer Fire Department for 13 years now.  I have served off and on as an EMT-B at various agencies.  Most recently, I have started working for West Virginia University's Fire Service Extension as an instructor.  This is an exciting new chapter in my fire service career, and a look forward to the opportunity to start training the next generation.

Thankfully when I have time to myself, I have a wonderful, loving wife and two kids that are always happy to see me.  They keep me going when I think stress is going to get the best of me, and that happens more frequently than any of us realize.  I am always looking forward to the next family trip.
