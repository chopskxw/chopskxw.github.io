Summary: Website is up, and the first done.

After about a full day's work, my new website is finally looking like something I'm happy with.  It has been an interesting learning experience, learning Pelican, Travis CI, and the facets of GitHub Pages all at the same time.  I am going to work on writing up what it took to make this happen, and the leasons learned along the way.  

In the meantime, bookmark the new site and check back soon.
